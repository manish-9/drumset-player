# drumset-player
A Drum Set Player made using javascript as a learning exercise (made for fun :D )

We all end up creating some tune or a melody in our heads but we can't find a drumset when we need one (at least I can't 🙁). So here's a app where you can give actual beats to those short lived melodies. It might not give the feel of a real expensive drumset but we don't can't spend so much on a drumset just to end up getting addicted to it right. After all we are programmers and coders, our hands are more suited to the keyboard😅 But you can still indulge your craving to hear those drum beats right over here.
